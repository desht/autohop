# AutoHop

AutoHop is an ultra-simple plugin with no configuration or commands, AutoHop detects when players are walking into blocks, and if there's room to jump onto that block, will automatically make them jump. If you've ever played Minecraft Pocket Edition on Android/IOS, you'll know what to expect.

## Installation and Usage

Detailed documentation can be found in BukkitDev: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/autohop

## Building

If you want to build AutoHop yourself, you will need Maven.

1) Run 'mvn clean install'

This should give you a copy of AutoHop.jar under the target/ directory.

Use 'mvn eclipse:eclipse' to create the .project and .classpath files if you want to open the project in Eclipse.
